Hey there! This is Group 18's repository for the final project in BIS15L. 
Our members include Adara LoCasio and Itzel Barrios. 
Our project focuses on the ABC reality TV show titled, "The Bachelor" in order to anaylze the success rates of the couples.
Adara was in charge of finding interesting data about the contestants; correlation between certain variables and roses given out.
Itze was in charge of finding the success rates of the couples and making an app that displayed the number of couples still together for the Bachelor and Bachelorette.
Both participants worked on the google slideshow.
